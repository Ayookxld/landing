# How to update Plutonium Mod

## Updating the Plutonium launcher

The launcher updates itself automatically when you start it so you shouldn't try updating it manually.
If you don't get the updates automatically this probably means that you pinned the Plutonium launcher while it was running.
To fix this simply follow these instructions:

1. Unpin Plutonium from your taskbar or start menu
2. Close any Plutonium game running and close the launcher if it's running
3. Pin `plutonium.exe` to your taskbar/start menu and start it

## Checking if your launcher is up-to-date

1. Open your launcher and click on your profile picture in the top right
2. Open the [changelog page](https://plutonium.pw/docs/changelog/)
3. Compare the Core version in your launcher and the latest changelog. If your Core version is inferior to the one on the changelog then you aren't up-to-date.
   (Note that the latest version is the one on the right `r2158-r2190` means that the previous version was `r2158` and that the latest version is `r2190`.

## Fixing "Failed to check for updates"

1. Go to where your Plutonium launcher (`plutonium.exe`) is located (this is often in your game files or on your desktop)
2. Delete the application file(s) named `plutonium` and `plutonium.new` (if you have it). Note that these applications could also end with the .exe extension if you have extensions enabled in Windows.
