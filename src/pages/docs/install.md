### I just want to update / I already have MW3 installed

If you already have the game installed from steam or had a previous update of Plutonium then you can skip the below section and move onto the [Installing the DLC](#installing-the-dlc) section.

### Installing the base game (Modern Warfare 3)

Note: This section will cover downloading a FREE copy of MW3. Please skip this section if you already have a copy of the game.

Please note we highly recommend buying the game if you do not own it, if you enjoy a game you should support it's developers.

1. Open Steam, if you do not have Steam installed you can download it [here](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)

2. Go to `LIBRARY` and from the dropdown menu select `TOOLS`

3. Locate `Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - Dedicated Server`, select it and then click the cog icon then `Properties`

![img](https://i.imgur.com/ln7ml3F.png)

4. Navigate to the `LANGUAGE` tab and ensure the language is step to `English` this is very important as unfortunately the Steam MW3 Dedicated Server does not support other languages so would result in missing files / errors. (I suggest purchasing the game on a key site if you want the game in your language)

5. Select `INSTALL` then `Next` then `Finish`
