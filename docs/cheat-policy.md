# Plutonium Cheat Policy

It is important you read and understand the following policy in regards to our anticheat system. 


## Upon detection of a  Cheat:

* Automatic ban of 7 days is placed onto the account.
* When the player tries to login, they will be displayed a message which tells them they are banned and also tells them how long is left until the ban expires.
* Attempting to bypass the ban in any way will lead to further restrictions. 
* Once the ban length has expired, the system will automatically remove the ban.
* If the player is caught cheating again, the system will ban the account permanently.
* We will not provide any information regarding any given ban, remember you broke our rules.

## Note
The anticheat is always active even in solo play / private match.  
If you wish to cheat in private / solo you can use the [launchers LAN mode](how-to-disable-anticheat) which disables online functionality and disables the anticheat.  

The anticheat will be triggered by the following but not limited to:

* Injections
* External tools and cheats
* GSC Injectors
* Rank Unlockers
* Class editors
* FoV/FPS changer programs

All official supported modding is safe including our built in GSC support.
