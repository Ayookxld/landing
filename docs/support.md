# Where can I get support?

You can find support in various places:  
* [Discord](https://discord.gg/plutonium) - This is useful if you have quick questions, the chats can flow quite quickly so bigger problems or issues where you are super stuck belong on the forums.
* [Plutonium Forums](https://forum.plutonium.pw) - We have dedicated sub-forums for each game, each sub-forum has a guide for how to post a detailed support request thread.

All support is given by community members just like yourself, so please remember to be clear with your support requests, take time to provide as much information as you can, upload screenshots and explain what you have tried already. These tips will mean people are more likely to take time to help you.
