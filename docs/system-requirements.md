# What are the requirements for Plutonium?

Plutonium does not have special requirements, any system capable of running the base games should be able to run Plutonium.
However the downloader requires a 64 bit system and the launcher requires DirectX 11.

Our system requirements are as follows:  
* Windows 8.1 (fully updated) or Windows 10 (recommended!) 64 bit
* A GPU that supports DirectX 9 (11 recommended).
* 500 MB free on C:\
