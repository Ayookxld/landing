# What are the requirements for Plutonium?

Plutonium does not have special requirements, any system capable of running the base games (with the exception of Windows 7) should be able to run Plutonium.
However the downloader requires a 64 bit system and the launcher requires DirectX 11. 

Our system requirements are as follows:  
* Windows 8.1 (fully updated) or Windows 10 (recommended!) 64 bit
* A GPU that supports DirectX 9 (11 recommended).
* 500 MB free on C:\


::: tip NOTE
Windows 7 reached End of Life on January 14th 2020 and as such is not supported by Microsoft, at Plutonium we believe in good security principles and as such also do not support Windows 7. We highly suggest upgrading to Windows 10.
