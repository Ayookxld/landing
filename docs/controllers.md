## Xbox Controllers

Xbox controllers should be plug-and-play with all our games. Simply plug your controller into your computer and open Plutonium.

## PS4 Controllers

PS4 Controllers require a bit more setup.

1\. Download [DS4Windows](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows/releases/latest). We recommend downloading `DS4Windows_VERSION_x64.zip`.

2\. Open the downloaded zip, and copy the `DS4Windows` folder to a safe place like your Documents folder.

3\. Open the extracted folder, then open `DS4Windows`
