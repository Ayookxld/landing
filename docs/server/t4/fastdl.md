# Setting up FastDL

1. Setup any form of Web Server. (Google is your friend here)

2. Place a copy of your `mods` and `usermaps` into your web server's root directory.

3. Verify you can access them from the public internet. [Here's an example](http://fastdl.cmh.pw/t4)

4. Set your `sv_wwwBaseURL` to your server's URL. (Example: `set sv_wwwBaseURL "http://100.100.100.100/"`)
